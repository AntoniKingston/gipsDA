Description: Extends classical linear and quadratic discriminant analysis
    by incorporating permutation group symmetries into covariance matrix
    estimation. The package leverages methodology from the ‘gips’
    framework to identify and impose permutation structures that act as a
    form of regularization, improving stability and interpretability in
    settings with symmetric or exchangeable features. Several discriminant
    analysis variants are provided, including pooled and class-specific
    covariance models, as well as multi-class extensions with shared or
    independent symmetry structures.
