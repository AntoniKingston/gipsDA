Description: Extends classical linear and quadratic discriminant analysis by incorporating
  permutation group symmetries into covariance matrix estimation. The package leverages
  methodology from the ‘gips’ framework to identify and impose permutation structures
  that act as a form of regularization, improving stability and interpretability in
  settings with symmetric or exchangeable features. Several discriminant analysis variants
  are provided, including pooled and class-specific covariance models, as well
  as multi-class extensions with shared or independent symmetry structures.
