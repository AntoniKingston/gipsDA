# Classification Datasets for Various Domains

Here are 5 datasets for classification tasks from the fields of medical diagnostics, rare-event detection, and industrial quality control, along with direct links.

### Medical Diagnostics

1.  **Heart Failure Prediction Dataset**
    *   **Description:** This dataset contains 11 clinical features that can be used to predict whether a patient has heart disease. It is a classic binary classification problem.
    *   **Target Variable:** `HeartDisease` (1 for heart disease, 0 for normal).

2.  **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set**
    *   **Description:** The features in this dataset are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The task is to classify tumors as malignant or benign.
    *   **Target Variable:** `diagnosis` (M = malignant, B = benign).

### Rare-Event Detection

3.  **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
    *   **Description:** This dataset contains credit card transactions made over two days by European cardholders. The challenge is to identify fraudulent transactions, which constitute a very small fraction of all transactions (a minority class).
    *   **Target Variable:** `Class` (1 for fraud, 0 for a legitimate transaction).

### Industrial Quality Control

4.  **Steel Plates Faults Dataset**
    *   **Description:** This dataset is from experiments on steel plates to identify different types of faults. The goal is to classify the fault type based on 27 different attributes. This is a multi-class classification problem.
    *   **Target Variable:** 7 different types of faults (e.g., `Pastry`, `Z_Scratch`, `K_Scatch`).

5.  **Sensorless Drive Diagnosis Data Set**
    *   **Description:** Data was collected from a sensorless drive to diagnose its condition. The task is to determine if a fault is present, based on 48 features from the current signal.
    *   **Target Variable:** The drive's condition (11 different fault classes).
