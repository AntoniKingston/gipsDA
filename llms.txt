An R package for discriminant analysis classification using covariance
matrices with permutation symmetries.

## About The Project

**gipsDA** is an R package that extends classical Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) by
incorporating permutation group structures into the estimation of
covariance matrices. By leveraging the methodology of the `gips`
library, this package aims to improve classification performance in
scenarios where features (variables) exhibit underlying symmetries.

The core idea is to find and impose a permutation symmetry on the
covariance matrix, which acts as a form of regularization and can lead
to more stable and interpretable models, especially in high-dimensional
settings. The ultimate goal is to submit `gipsDA` to the Comprehensive R
Archive Network (CRAN).

### Key Features

- Implementation of four novel `gips`-based discriminant analysis
  classifiers.
- A flexible, user-friendly model API consistent with established
  machine learning libraries in R.
- A specialized `gipsmult` module for modeling class-specific
  covariances under a shared symmetry.
- Designed following best practices for R package development.

## R Package Structure

To adopt the best practices of R package development, the repository is
organized with the following standard structure:

- #### `R/`

  This directory contains the core logic of the package. All source code
  files are located here. To ensure proper documentation, we use the
  `roxygen2` package, with documentation comments embedded directly
  above the function definitions. To maintain logical modularity within
  this flat directory structure, a file naming convention has been
  adopted, where files are prefixed to indicate their module
  affiliation:

  - `gipsmult_`: for files belonging to the `gipsmult` module.
  - `models_`: for files belonging to the `models` module.

- #### `tests/`

  This directory houses all testing scripts to ensure the reliability
  and correctness of the package. Automated unit tests are implemented
  using the `testthat` framework and are designed to verify the
  functionality of individual functions and methods within the modules.

## Available Models in `gipsDA`

The `gipsDA` object can be configured to run one of four different
classification algorithms, each with different assumptions about the
data structure.

1.  **`gipsLDA_weighted_average`** In this approach, a separate
    covariance matrix is first estimated for each class. A final, single
    covariance matrix is then computed as a **weighted average** of
    these individual matrices. This pooled matrix is then processed by
    the `gips` library before being used for classification.

2.  **`gipsLDA_classic`** This model follows a more traditional approach
    by using the **classic pooled covariance estimator** standard in
    traditional LDA. This single, pooled matrix is then processed by the
    `gips` library to find the most probable permutation symmetry.

3.  **`gipsMultQDA`** This model leverages the `gipsmult` module. The
    process involves first identifying the single most probable
    **permutation structure that is common across all classes**.
    Subsequently, a separate covariance matrix is estimated for each
    class, with each matrix being projected onto this shared
    permutation.

4.  **`gipsQDA`** This represents the most flexible model. The `gips`
    library is applied **independently to each class**. Consequently,
    each class can have its own uniquely estimated permutation structure
    and its own distinct covariance matrix. This is analogous to the
    classic QDA framework but with individualized symmetry discovery for
    each class.
